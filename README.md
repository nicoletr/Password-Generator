# Password-Generator
This applications aim is to use Javascript to generate a random secure password for the user. <br>
Once the user clicks the 'Generate' button they are presented with a series of criteria for their random password. <br>
They can choose the length, and whether or not it will include a symbol, number, upper case letter and/or lower case letter. <br>
Once they have chosen these, the password is generated for them to copy and use.<br>
<br>
The generatePassword function is not finished in my code as of yet and needs to be worked on to generate the password.<br><br>
